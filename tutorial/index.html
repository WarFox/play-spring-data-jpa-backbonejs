        Play with Spring Data Jpa
    </h2>

    <p>
        <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-data/jpa" target="_blank">Spring Data Jpa</a> provides a higher
        level of abstraction than having to deal with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API" target="_blank">Jpa</a> api directly. A great deal
        of boilerplate code can be avoided when using Spring Data Jpa. When you combine Spring Data Jpa with Play you
        can focus on solving the business problem at hand.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project uses Java but can work equally as well with Scala.
    </p>

    <p>
        This tutorial will take about 10 minutes to complete and assumes that you are already familiar with the basics
        of a Play application.
    </p>

    <h2>
        The Domain Model
    </h2>

    <p>
        Our domain model is simple for the purposes of demonstrating Spring Data.
        <a href="#code/app/models/Person.java" class="shortcut">Person</a> describes a Jpa entity with
        a few properties, namely id, firstname and surname.
    </p>

    <p>
        The members are declared public as Jpa entities tend to
        be simple structures. When behaviour is required then it tends to be related to the instance. Class level
        behaviour is relegated to a repository e.g. finding instances (discussed next).
    </p>

    <p>
        Play will synthesise getters and setters for public properties so they do not have to be declared. You
        typically declare getters and setters when you require behaviour beyond getting or setting the property. Getters
        and setters are required by Jpa for entity classes, so this is a nice saving of code given Play.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>
        Repositories
    </h2>

    <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design#Building_blocks_of_DDD"
           target="_blank">Repositories</a> represent the operations that are performed on an "aggregate root" object.
        The aggregate root ensures the consistency of changes being made within the aggregate e.g. if an Order is
        to be saved then any associated order details are saved along with it. Operations on a repository therefore
        tend to be atomic in nature and manage their own transactions.
    </p>

    <p>
        We have created a simple <a href="#code/app/models/PersonRepository.java" class="shortcut">PersonRepository</a>
        that extends Spring Jpa's <a
            href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/CrudRepository.html"
            target="_blank">CrudRepository</a>; Crud representing common Create Retrieve Update and Delete operations.
        We use <code>@Named</code> to declare that the repository is available for dependency injection and
        <code>@Singleton</code> to declare that only one instance of it is generally required.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can do a great deal with Spring Data Jpa and provide custom behaviour for the repository. The operations
        on a repository tend to relate strongly to how the logic layer (web controllers) atomically consumes and
        produces data.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>
        The Application
    </h2>

    <p>
        <a href="#code/app/controllers/Application.java" class="shortcut">Application</a> represents a conventional
        means of making a synchronous, blocking call to a database (JPA is synchronous and blocking). The repository
        is injected into the controller via constructor injection via the use of <code>@Inject</code>. We use
        constructor injection in order to promote an immutable programming model. Immutable variables assist toward
        providing an inherently thread-safe application.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that you have not had to provide any code to perform the repository's <code>save</code> or
        <code>findOne</code> operations. Spring Data did that for you.
    </p>

    <p>
        As with the repository being used, <code>Application</code> is declared as being injectable
        as a single instance via <code>@Inject</code> and <code>@Singleton</code> respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because Spring's dependency injection system is being used we declare Application as a class with instance
        methods as opposed to static methods. This is so that we can have Play ask our <code>Global</code> object
        for instances of <code>Application</code> that have been subjected to dependency injection. More on the
        <code>Global</code> object next.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>
        The Global
    </h2>

    <p>
        <a href="#code/app/Global.java" class="shortcut">Global</a> sets up Spring's dependency injection system and
        configures Spring Data with Jpa concerns.
    </p>

    <p>
        An <code>AnnotationConfigApplicationContext</code> is established and started such that it scans the
        <code>controllers</code> and <code>models</code> packages for <code>@Named</code> classes to become
        available for dependency injection. In addition a <code>SpringDataJpaConfiguration</code> inner class is
        instantiated and provides further configuration of Spring Data. In particular an
        <code>EntityManagerFactory</code> is made available that uses the a Jpa persistence unit named "default".
        You can see this persistence unit declared in <code>conf/META-INF/persistence.xml</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>getControllerInstance</code> method is called on by Play whenever a controller is required. More
        specifically Play will call <code>getControllerInstance</code> when it finds an '@' symbol in front of a
        route declaration. Check out the <a href="#code/conf/routes" class="shortcut">routes</a> file for the
        declaration of <code>controllers.Application.index</code>. We pass on the responsibility of locating a
        controller instance to Spring so that it is subject to dependency injection.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>
        Testing
    </h2>

    <p>
        <a href="#code/test/controllers/ApplicationIT.java" class="shortcut">ApplicationIT</a> provides an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing" target="_blank">integration test</a> for the
        <code>Application</code> controller. The purpose of the test is to exercise the
        routing configuration and the logic within the controller's methods. Dependencies of the controller are
        not intended to be tested here and so the <code>PeopleRepository</code> is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object" target="_blank">mocked</a>. Most importantly no database
        is required to be established for this test to run, thereby resulting in a simpler and perhaps faster test.
    </p>

    <p>
        The mocked <code>PeopleRepository</code> is manually injected into the <code>Application</code> controller,
        and the controller is made available in a stub implementation of the <code>GlobalSettings</code> class.
        Because the test extends <code>WithApplication</code>, it is focused on testing a Play application. We
        construct a <code>FakeApplication</code> with the instance of the <code>GlobalSetting</code> stub as part of the
        test setup. The <code>indexSavesDataAndReturnsId</code> test then performs its specific setup and routes a
        <code>GET</code> request. Finally expectations are set on the response.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Conclusion
    </h2>

    <p>
        This tutorial has taken you through the requirements of a Play application in order to use Spring Data Jpa.
        While this project uses Java you can use Scala equally as well. Spring Data also provides support for
        NoSQL stores and so a similar setup to this project can be used for many types of repository.
    </p>

    <p>
        Happy Play-ing with Spring Data.
